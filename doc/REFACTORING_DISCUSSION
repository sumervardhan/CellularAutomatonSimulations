During the lab, we made several changes; however, because we did not know that there was an actual lab to be turned in that requires the creation and submission of a new branch, we didn’t make the new branch and mostly worked together off of HaDev’s branch to refractor. Many of this refactoring can be found in Commit 4deffa62, “Merge branch ‘HaDev’ into ‘master’.” One change we made was removing the wild card import for the Grid class; this change was made to remove unnecessary imports on things that we do not need, and to keep the import only specific to what we do need. Another change made was changing all elements such as “ArrayLists” or “HashSets” or such specific types to generics; this was implemented in order to allow for better and more complete support of different types, so that, say, if somebody were to change the implementation of a list, we would be able to support it. Also, because we didn’t know that we were supposed to have everything pushed and turned in, we also began the refactoring process for our longest method at the time, which was the SetCellNeighbors method.This was done alongside with refactoring packages for the XML parser, as before, we had the parser for both the game and the simulation class in the same class; this was not efficient because their fields data were not the same. As such, it would make it much harder for error checking against valid and invalid schema. Though the process for this was started in class, this was merged later on, in “Refractored XML parser and implemented BFS for ad

ding cells neighbor.”
